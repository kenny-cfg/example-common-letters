'''
Question 1
Write a function that takes in a sentence and returns the 3 most common letters. 
Spaces should not be counted as letters.
Raise a custom exception when this function wouldnâ€™t be able to return 3 common
letters.
Question 2
Write unit tests for the previous function. Make sure it covers valid, invalid and edge
cases.
